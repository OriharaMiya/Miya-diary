<caption>2025年5月20日情绪与行为记录 Emotional & Behavioral Log</caption>
<tr>
  <th>时间与事件<br>Time & Event</th>
  <td>早上6点闹钟响了但没醒，拖到7点多才起床，外面下雨不想出门。起床后煮泡面，吃完就开始出车工作。<br>
Alarm rang at 6 AM but couldn't get up, finally got up past 7. It was raining, didn’t want to go out. Made instant noodles and started work afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>工作情况<br>Work Condition</th>
  <td>白天下雨订单不多但还算顺利。中途买了一个甜甜圈，非常油腻且难吃，吃完后腹泻。工作到晚上8点回家。<br>
Rain affected order volume but overall manageable. Bought a doughnut during the day that was greasy and unpleasant, caused diarrhea afterwards. Finished working by 8 PM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>晚间生活<br>Evening</th>
  <td>去超市买了泡面和寿司，回家后吃得很饱。晚上11点想洗澡，发现父亲在洗，感觉被占用很烦，放弃洗澡。<br>
Went to the supermarket, bought noodles and sushi. Ate a lot after returning home. At 11 PM wanted to shower but father was using the bathroom again, felt annoyed and gave up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>情绪记录<br>Emotion</th>
  <td>早上想到辍学逃避的过去哭了，深夜想到明天早起充电很烦。工作中一度想死，但已忘记原因。整体情绪低沉、反复。<br>
Cried in the morning when reminded of quitting school to escape pressure. At night, overwhelmed thinking about getting up at 4 AM for charging. Had a suicidal thought during the day but forgot the reason later. Emotions were low and fluctuating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>总结<br>Summary</th>
  <td>今天情绪波动主要来源于天气与工作压力。小事（如家庭卫生间使用、甜食不合口味）也能诱发烦躁。下雨虽是小事，却触发了深层的无力与逃避感。<br>
Emotional swings were mostly due to weather and work stress. Small events (like bathroom conflict or unpleasant food) triggered irritation. The rain, though minor, surfaced deeper feelings of powerlessness and avoidance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>心理学分析<br>Psychological Analysis</th>
  <td>你在逃避与自责之间反复挣扎，表明潜意识对过往决定（如辍学）仍怀有羞耻和内疚。当前的工作状态激活这些未解的情绪创伤。身体上的不适（腹泻、睡眠不足）也加剧了情绪的疲劳。<br>
You're cycling between avoidance and self-blame, indicating that past decisions (like dropping out) still carry shame and guilt in your subconscious. The current job may be reactivating those unresolved emotional wounds. Physical discomfort (like diarrhea and sleep issues) intensifies emotional fatigue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>建议<br>Suggestions</th>
  <td>1. 给自己留一些喘息空间，下雨可以选择短时休息而非全盘否定自己。<br>
1. Allow yourself brief breaks without judging your worth — resting during rain isn’t failure.<br><br>
2. 睡眠习惯和饮食需要规律，避免刺激性食物（如甜甜圈）引发身体不适。<br>
2. Regularize sleep and meals, avoid greasy food to prevent discomfort.<br><br>
3. 练习自我宽恕：你不是当年的你，现在的你已经能面对并努力生活。<br>
3. Practice self-forgiveness: you're not the person you were — now you're facing life and doing your best.</td>
